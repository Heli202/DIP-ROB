## Section 6: Mapping to Units of Competency
**Objective:** Demonstrate how this work addresses specific elements and performance criteria (PC) from ICTAII501 and ICTAII502. Fill in the "Evidence from Your Work" column with references to your documentation above.  

| Unit | Element | Performance Criteria (PC) | Evidence from Your Work (How it Maps) |
|------|---------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| ICTAII501 (Automate work tasks using machine learning) | 1. Identify tasks for automation | 1.1 Confirm work brief and tasks according to organisational policies and procedures<br>1.2 Analyse ML requirements according to CRISP-DM methodology | [e.g., "Section 1: Identified puzzle detection as automation need using CRISP-DM business understanding phase."] |
| | 2. Design ML solution | (Assumed: Select data, tools, and parameters) | [e.g., "Section 1: Selected Roboflow and Jetson tools for design."] |
| | 3. Document design | (Assumed: Record processes) | [e.g., "Sections 1-3: Documented planning and implementation."] |
| ICTAII502 (Train and evaluate machine learning models) | 1. Evaluate data requirements | 1.1 Confirm work brief and tasks according to organisational policies and procedures<br>1.2 Analyse ML requirements according to CRISP-DM methodology, where required<br>1.3 Confirm input machine training data source according to work brief<br>1.4 Confirm that data attribute names contain target according to work brief<br>1.5 Review data transformation instructions according to work brief<br>1.6 Confirm that default and non-default training parameters control required learning algorithm according to work brief | [e.g., "Section 1: Confirmed data sources and transformations."] |
| | 2. Arrange machine training datasets | 2.1 Set machine training data parameters according to work brief<br>2.2 Select model size according to work brief<br>2.3 Use selected parameter and feature engineering on required training data<br>2.4 Finalise machine training data procedures according to work brief | [e.g., "Section 2: Set parameters and engineered features in training."] |
| | 3. Arrange validation datasets | 3.1 Set validation data parameters according to work brief<br>3.2 Select model size according to work brief<br>3.3 Use selected parameter and feature engineering on required validation data<br>3.4 Identify any functionality issues of parameters<br>3.5 Refine ML parameters according to work brief | [e.g., "Section 2: Validation set setup and refinements."] |
| | 4. Arrange test datasets | 4.1 Set test data parameters according to work brief<br>4.2 Select model size according to work brief<br>4.3 Use selected parameter and feature engineering on required test data<br>4.4 Identify and rectify any functionality issues in test dataset<br>4.5 Finalise test data procedures according to work brief | [e.g., "Section 2: Test set and issue resolution."] |
| | 5. Finalise ML evaluations | 5.1 Review target data outputs according to work brief<br>5.2 Adjust model based on any discrepancies of outputs, where required<br>5.3 Record predictive accuracy of ML model according to work brief<br>5.4 Run variables through ML model and record outputs<br>5.5 Compare outputs returned by ML model against target data outputs<br>5.6 Document metrics and accuracy of ML data predictions according to organisational policies and procedures | [e.g., "Section 3: Evaluated metrics and documented accuracy."] |
| Foundation Skills (Both Units) | Numeracy, Reading, Writing, Problem Solving | (e.g., Interpret data, calculate metrics, solve issues) | [e.g., "Section 3: Used numeracy for accuracy calculations; problem-solved overfitting."] |

**Note on Mapping:** For ICTAII501, performance criteria are assumed based on unit title and similar structures; consult your trainer for exact details if needed. This step primarily demonstrates ICTAII502 (training/evaluation) while contributing to ICTAII501's automation design.
