# Applying CRISP-DM Methodology to the PuzzArm Project

**Document Purpose:**  
This document applies the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology to the PuzzArm project, structuring the AI/ML components (e.g., image identification for puzzle pieces, pose estimation, and imitation learning for arm control) across its six phases. CRISP-DM provides an iterative, non-linear framework for ML projects, emphasising business alignment and continuous refinement. This application serves as a checkpoint for the clustered AI course, mapping to ICTAII501 (designing AI solutions) and ICTAII502 (implementing ML models).

Use this as Assessment template, filling in project-specific details based on your work (e.g., Roboflow training/Arm training ).

**Project Recap:** PuzzArm is an AI-powered robotic system using Jetson Nano and xArm1S to solve a number puzzle (0-9 pieces), with dual-arm teleop (or similar method) for data collection. The ML focus is on vision-based detection, classification, and motion policies.

**Iteration Note:** CRISP-DM is cyclical—after Deployment, loop back to Business Understanding for refinements (e.g., adding new puzzles).

## Phase 1: Business Understanding
**Objective:** Define the problem, goals, and success criteria in business terms. Assess resources and risks.  

- **Business Problem:** Automate puzzle solving to create an educational robotics demo for expo demonstrations  and marketing events.
- **Data Mining Goals:** Develop models for piece detection (~70% accuracy), pose estimation (handling rotations), and arm control (50% pick-place success).  
- **Project Plan:** Timeline (4-6 weeks); resources (Jetson Nano, xArm1S, Roboflow). 
- **Risks:**

- ***Student Input:*** [Describe how you  addressed the  business need 100-200 words]  

   *Mapping to Units:** ICTAII501 PC 1.1-1.2 (confirm work brief via CRISP-DM business phase).*

## Phase 2: Data Understanding
**Objective:** Collect initial data, explore it, and identify quality issues.  

- **Initial Data Collection:** 100-200 images of puzzle pieces/slots from top-down camera (via Jetson CSI), plus teleop videos (ROS2 bags) for joint states. Sources: Manual photos, Roboflow public datasets for augmentation.  
- **Data Description:** Structure (images: RGB, 224x224; labels: 0-9 classes; joints: 6D floats). Volume: ~5k samples post-augmentation.  
- **Data Exploration:** Use pandas/matplotlib for histograms (e.g., class balance: 10% per digit); identify issues (e.g., lighting bias via correlation plots).  
- **Student Input:** [From Part 1: Summarise your Roboflow dataset stats, e.g., "50 images/class; explored via Hello AI tools, found 20% rotation variance." Include a sample plot code/output.]  
  ```python
  # Example exploration code (adapt from your work)
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  # Load data and plot class distribution
  plt.bar(classes, counts)
  plt.show()
  ```  
*Mapping to Units ICTAII502 PC 1.1-1.6 (analyse requirements and data attributes using CRISP-DM data phase).*

## Phase 3: Data Preparation
**Objective:** Clean, transform, and construct the final dataset for modeling.  

- **Data Cleaning:** Remove duplicates/blurry images (OpenCV thresholding); handle missing labels via Roboflow auto-annotation.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Augment for rotations (0-360° via Albumentations); normalize images (0-1 scale); engineer joint deltas from teleop recordings.  
- **Final Dataset:** Train (70%): 3.5k samples; Val (20%): 1k; Test (10%): 500. Format: PyTorch DataLoader for Jetson training.  
- **Student Input:** [Detail your prep from thumbs classifier/Roboflow, e.g., "Applied flips and brightness augments to address orientation issues." Include before/after metrics, e.g., variance reduction.]  
- **Mapping to Units:** ICTAII502 PC 2.1-2.4 (set parameters, engineer features per CRISP-DM prep phase).

**Objective:** Select and apply ML techniques, tuning parameters.  

- **Model Selection:** - *Student input* - Name, use etc
- **Techniques Applied:** - *Student input* - eg, Supervised training 
- **Model Building:**  - *Student input* - eg, Train detection first (output: boxes/classes); then policy (input: cropped image + joints; output: 6D deltas). Export to TensorRT.  

*Mapping to Units ICTAII502 PC 3.1-3.5 (arrange validation, refine parameters via CRISP-DM modeling).*

## Phase 5: Evaluation
**Objective:** Assess model performance against business goals; review process.  

- **Model Assessment:** - *Student input* - eg, Metrics: Detection,  Policy success rate, pick-place trials,  Use confusion matrix for classes.
- **Business Criteria Check:** Does it enable full puzzle solve <5 min?  - *Student input* 
- **Process Review:** Data quality issues? (e.g., rotations fixed via augments). Next iteration: - *Student input*

**Objective:** Plan rollout, monitoring, and maintenance.  

- **Deployment Plan:** *Student input* - eg, Deploy on Jetson.  
- **Monitoring:** *Student input* - eg, Log pickup  time (<100ms); retrain quarterly with new demos.  
- **Business Reporting:** *Student input*  - Demo video; report ROI (e.g. What it can do for the time invested). Maintenance: Version models in GitHub/Gitlab]
